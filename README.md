# Project Ideas

A small repo consisting of just this file with ideas for projects when I have some free time. 
Reminder to self: check if these actually exist before starting.

- [ ] Golang mx blacklist checker - a cool way to demo Go's concurrency
- [ ] Angular/Angular Material context menu
- [ ] Go WHMCS bindings to external API
- [ ] GPX/TCX/FIT service - connect via WS, get an ID, and post coords. Server takes care of the rest. (Check out https://github.com/adriangibbons/php-fit-file-analysis for real samples of using/decoding FIT files.)
